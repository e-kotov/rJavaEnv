Description: Install specific version of Java runtime environment at the R
    project level. The goal of rJavaEnv is to manage multiple Java JDKs in
    R projects by automating the process of downloading, installing, and
    configuring Java environments on a per-project basis.  This package is
    inspired by the renv <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/> package for
    managing R environments in R projects. You can request a specific Java
    Development Kit (JDK) in your project, and rJavaEnv will download and
    install the requested Java environment in a project-specific directory
    and set the PATH and JAVA_HOME for when you are using this project.
    Therefore, you can have different Java versions for different projects
    without contaminating your system with different Java versions.
