Description: The 'rJavaEnv' package addresses common issues with 'Java'
    environment management in 'R' for users of 'Java'/'rJava'-dependent
    'R' packages such as 'r5r', 'opentripplanner', 'xlsx', 'openNLP',
    'rWeka', 'RJDBC', 'tabulapdf', and many more. It resolves common
    problems like 'Java' not found, 'Java' version conflicts, missing
    'Java' installations, and the inability to install 'Java' due to lack
    of administrative privileges. 'rJavaEnv' automates the download,
    installation, and setup of the 'Java Development Kit' ('JDK') on a
    per-project basis by setting the relevant 'JAVA_HOME' in the current
    'R' session or the current working directory (via '.Rprofile', with
    the user's consent). Similar to what 'renv' does for 'R' packages,
    'rJavaEnv' allows different 'Java' versions to be used across
    different projects, but can also be configured to allow multiple
    versions within the same project (e.g.  with the help of 'targets'
    package). Note: there are a few extra steps for 'Linux' users, who
    don't have any 'Java' previously installed in their system, and who
    prefer package installation from source, rather then installing
    binaries from 'Posit Package Manager'. See documentation for details.
