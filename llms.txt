# rJavaEnv: Java Environments for R Projects

Quickly install `Java Development Kit (JDK)` without administrative
privileges and set environment variables in current R session or project
to solve common issues with ‘Java’ environment management in ‘R’.
Recommended to users of
`Java`/[rJava](http://www.rforge.net/rJava/)-dependent `R` packages such
as [r5r](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r),
[opentripplanner](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner),
[xlsx](https://github.com/colearendt/xlsx), `{openNLP}`, `{rWeka}`,
[RJDBC](http://www.rforge.net/RJDBC/),
[tabulapdf](https://docs.ropensci.org/tabulapdf/), and many more.
[rJavaEnv](https://github.com/e-kotov/rJavaEnv) prevents common problems
like `Java` not found, `Java` version conflicts, missing `Java`
installations, and the inability to install `Java` due to lack of
administrative privileges.
[rJavaEnv](https://github.com/e-kotov/rJavaEnv) automates the download,
installation, and setup of the `Java` on a per-project basis by setting
the relevant `JAVA_HOME` in the current `R` session or the current
working directory (via `.Rprofile`, with the user’s consent). Similar to
what [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) does for `R` packages,
[rJavaEnv](https://github.com/e-kotov/rJavaEnv) allows different `Java`
versions to be used across different projects, but can also be
configured to allow multiple versions within the same project (e.g. with
the help of [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package). For
users who need to install [rJava](http://www.rforge.net/rJava/) or other
`Java`-dependent packages from source,
[rJavaEnv](https://github.com/e-kotov/rJavaEnv) will display a message
with instructions on how to run `R CMD javareconf` to make the Java
configuration permanent, but also provides a function
[`java_build_env_set()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_build_env_set.md)
that sets the environment variables in the current R session temporarily
to allow installation of [rJava](http://www.rforge.net/rJava/) from
source without `R CMD javareconf`. On Linux, in addition to setting
environment variables, [rJavaEnv](https://github.com/e-kotov/rJavaEnv)
also dynamically loads `libjvm.so` to ensure
[rJava](http://www.rforge.net/rJava/) works correctly. See
[documentation](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/articles/rJavaEnv.html#note-linux)
for more details.\*\*

## Install

Install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages('rJavaEnv')
```

Install the development version

Install the latest release development version from **R-multiverse**:

``` r
install.packages('rJavaEnv',
 repos = c('https://community.r-multiverse.org', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

You can also install the development version of `rJavaEnv` directly from
GitHub:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github("e-kotov/rJavaEnv", force = TRUE)
```

## Simple Example

``` r
rJavaEnv::java_quick_install(version = 21)
```

This will:

- download `Java` 21 distribution compatible with the current operating
  system and processor architecture into a local cache folder;

- extract the downloaded `Java` distribution into another cache folder;

- create a symbolic link (for macOS and Linux) or junction (for Windows,
  if that fails, just copies the files)
  **rjavaenv/`platform`/`processor_architecture`/`java_version`** in the
  current directory/project to point to the cached installation;

- set the current session’s `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables
  to point to the installed (symlinked) `Java` distribution;

- add code to `.Rprofile` file in the current directory/project to set
  `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables when the project is
  opened in RStudio.

As part of normal operation, `rJavaEnv` will update the `JAVA_HOME` and
`PATH` environment variables in the current R session, the local cache
in your R package library, and the `.Rprofile` file in the
project/current working directory. In line with [CRAN
policies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html),
explicit user consent is required before making these changes.
Therefore, the first time you run any function from `rJavaEnv` that
makes such changes, you will be asked for consent. To explicitly consent
and/or to prevent interruptions in non-interactive mode, you can use the
[`rje_consent()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/rje_consent.md)
function:

``` r
rje_consent(provided = TRUE)
```

## Using `rJavaEnv` with `targets` and `callr`

Just insert this line at the top of any script that you run with
`targets` or `callr`:

``` r
rJavaEnv::use_java("21")
```

This acts exactly like
[`java_quick_install()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_quick_install.md),
but only sets the environment variables in the current session and does
not copy or link `Java` binaries into the project directory.

More details are in the vignette [Multiple `Java` environments in one
project with `targets` and
`callr`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/articles/multiple-java-with-targets-callr.html).

## Cleanup

If you do not want to use `rJavaEnv` anymore, please clear the cache
folders before removing the package:

``` r
java_clear("project", delete_all = TRUE)
java_clear("installed", delete_all = TRUE)
java_clear("distrib", delete_all = TRUE)
```

Also, clear the `.Rprofile` file in the projects there you used the
package:

``` r
java_env_unset()
```

## Functions Overview

The package has several core functions:

1.  [`java_quick_install()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_quick_install.md)

    - Downloads, installs, and sets Java environment in the current
      working/project directory, all in one line of code.

2.  [`java_check_version_cmd()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_check_version_cmd.md)

    - Checks the installed Java version using terminal commands. For
      packages like
      [`opentripplanner`](https://github.com/ropensci/opentripplanner),
      that performs Java calls using command line.

3.  `java_version_check_rjava()`

    - Checks the installed `Java` version using `rJava` in a separate R
      session. For `rJava`-dependent packages such as
      [`r5r`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r).

4.  [`java_download()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_download.md)

    - Downloads a specified version and distribution of `Java`.

5.  [`java_install()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_install.md)

    - Installs a `Java` distribution file into current (or
      user-specified) project directory.

6.  [`java_env_set()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_env_set.md)

    - Sets the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables to a given
      path in current R session and/or in the `.Rprofile` file in the
      project directory.

7.  [`java_env_unset()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_env_unset.md)

    - Removes the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables from the
      `.Rprofile` file in the project directory (but not in the current
      R session, please restart the session so that R picks up the
      system Java).

8.  [`java_list()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_list.md)

    - Lists all or some `Java` versions linked in the current project
      (or cached distributions or installations).

9.  [`java_clear()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_clear.md)

    - Removes all or some `Java` versions linked in the current project
      (or cached distributions or installations).

10. [`java_valid_versions()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_valid_versions.md)

    - Lists all valid major `Java` versions that can be downloaded and
      installed for either current automatically detected OS and CPU
      architecture or user-specified platform and architecture.

11. [`use_java()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/use_java.md)

    - Same as
      [`java_quick_install()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_quick_install.md),
      but in a less intrusive way. Does not copy or link the `Java`
      installation folder from cache into the project directory and does
      not create or edit your `.Rprofile` file. Only sets requested java
      in the current R session.

12. [`java_build_env_set()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_build_env_set.md)
    (and
    [`java_build_env_unset()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_build_env_unset.md))

    - Similar to
      [`java_env_set()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_env_set.md),
      but specifically designed for setting `Java` environment variables
      for building `rJava` from source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

See more details on all the functions in the
[Reference](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/index.html).

For detailed usage, see the [Quick Start
Vignette](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/articles/rJavaEnv.html).

## Limitations

Currently, `rJavaEnv` only supports major `Java` versions such as 8, 11,
15 to 24 and any newer version. The download and install functions
ignore the minor version of the `Java` distribution and just downloads
the latest stable subversion of the specified major version. This is
done to simplify the process and avoid the need to update the package
every time a new minor version of `Java` is released. For most users
this should be sufficient, but this is substandard for full
reproducibility.

The main limitation is that if you want to switch to another `Java`
environment, you will most likely have to restart the current R session
and set the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables to the desired
`Java` environment using
[`rJavaEnv::java_env_set()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_env_set.md).
This cannot be done dynamically within the same R session due to the way
Java is initialized in R, particularly with the `rJava`-dependent
packages such as [`r5r`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r). With packages
like [`opentripplanner`](https://github.com/ropensci/opentripplanner),
that performs `Java` calls using command line, you can switch `Java`
environments dynamically within the same R session as much as you want.

Therefore, if you need to use R packages that depend on different `Java`
versions within the same project, you will have to create separate R
scripts for each `Java` environment and run them in separate R sessions.
One effective way of doing this is to use the
[`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) package to run R scripts in
separate R sessions. Another option is to use the
[`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) package to manage the
whole project workflow, which, as a side effect, will lead to all R
scripts being run in separate R sessions. To use `rJavaEnv` with
`targets`, you will need to download and install several Java
environments using
[`rJavaEnv::java_download()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_download.md)
and
[`rJavaEnv::java_install()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_install.md)
and set the relevant path with
[`rJavaEnv::java_env_set()`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/reference/java_env_set.md)
at the beginning of each function that requires a certain `Java`
version.

## Future work

The future work includes:

- Add support for more `Java` distributions and versions

- Take care of
  [`R CMD javareconf`](https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/using-rjava/#reconfigure-r)

- Possibly add support for specifying `Java` version beyond the major
  version

- Possibly allow downloading several `Java` distributions in one
  function call, e.g. different major versions of the same ‘flavour’ or
  different ‘flavours’ of the same major version

- Possibly add automation to get the `Java` that is required by specific
  `Java`-dependent R packages
