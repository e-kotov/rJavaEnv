\arguments{
\item{version}{Integer or character. \strong{Required.} The Java version you need (e.g., 17, 21). Defaults to \code{NULL}, which is invalid and will trigger a validation error; callers should always provide a non-\code{NULL} value explicitly.}

\item{type}{Character. \code{"exact"} (default) checks for exact version match. \code{"min"} checks for version >= \code{version}.}

\item{accept_system_java}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the function will scan the system for existing Java installations (using \code{JAVA_HOME}, \code{PATH}, and OS-specific locations). If a system Java matching the \code{version} and \code{type} requirements is found, it will be used. Set to \code{FALSE} to ignore system installations and strictly use an \code{rJavaEnv} managed version.}

\item{install}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), attempts to download/install if missing.
If \code{FALSE}, returns \code{FALSE} if the version is not found.}

\item{distribution}{Character. The Java distribution to download. Defaults to "Corretto".}

\item{check_against}{Character. Controls which context validity the function checks against.
\itemize{
\item \code{"rJava"} (default): Checks if the requested version can be enforced for \code{rJava}. If \code{rJava} is already initialized and locked to a different version, this will error, as the requested version cannot be enforced for the active \code{rJava} session.
\item \code{"cmd"}: Checks if the requested version can be enforced for command-line use. This ignores the state of \code{rJava} and allows setting the environment variables even if \code{rJava} is locked to a different version.
}}

\item{quiet}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether to suppress messages. Can be \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cache_path}{The destination directory to download the Java distribution to. Defaults to a user-specific data directory.}

\item{platform}{The platform for which to download the Java distribution. Defaults to the current platform.}

\item{arch}{The architecture for which to download the Java distribution. Defaults to the current architecture.}

\item{.use_cache}{A \code{logical} value controlling caching behavior. If \code{FALSE} (default),
performs a fresh check each time (safe, reflects current state). If \code{TRUE}, uses
session-scoped cached results for performance in loops or repeated calls.

\strong{Caching Behavior:}
\itemize{
\item Session-scoped: Cache is cleared when R restarts
\item Key-based for version checks: Changes to JAVA_HOME create new cache entries
\item System-wide for scanning: Always recalculates current default Java
}

\strong{Performance Benefits:}
\itemize{
\item First call: ~37-209ms (depending on operation)
\item Cached calls: <1ms
\item Prevents 30-100ms delays on every call in performance-critical code
}

\strong{When to Enable:}
\itemize{
\item Package initialization code (\code{.onLoad} or similar)
\item Loops calling the same function multiple times
\item Performance-critical paths with frequent version checks
}

\strong{When to Keep Default (FALSE):}
\itemize{
\item Interactive use (one-off checks)
\item When you need current data reflecting recent Java installations
\item General-purpose function calls that aren't time-critical
}}

\item{.check_rjava_fun}{Internal. Function to check if rJava is initialized.}

\item{.rjava_ver_fun}{Internal. Function to get the current rJava version.}
}
\value{
Logical. \code{TRUE} if the requirement is met (active or set successfully), \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Checks for a specific Java version in the following order:
\enumerate{
\item Checks if the currently active session has the required version.
\item (Optional) Scans system for installed Java (via \code{java_find_system}).
\item Checks if the required version is already cached in \code{rJavaEnv}'s installed cache.
\item If none found, downloads and installs the version (if \code{install = TRUE}).
}

This function is designed to be "lazy": it will do nothing if a valid Java version
is already detected, making it safe to use in scripts or package startup code
(provided \code{install = FALSE}).
}
\section{Additional Notes}{

If rJava is already loaded, this function will warn you but will not prevent the
environment variable change (which won't help rJava at that point).
}

\section{rJava Path-Locking}{

\strong{Important for \emph{rJava} Users}: This function sets environment variables
(JAVA_HOME, PATH) that affect both command-line Java tools and \emph{rJava} initialization.
However, due to \emph{rJava}'s path-locking behavior when \code{\link[rJava]{.jinit}} is called
(see \url{https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/25}, \url{https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/249}, and \url{https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/334}),
this function must be called \strong{BEFORE} \code{\link[rJava]{.jinit}} is invoked. Once \code{\link[rJava]{.jinit}}
initializes, the Java version is locked for that R session and cannot be changed without restarting R.

\code{\link[rJava]{.jinit}} is invoked (and Java locked) when you:
\itemize{
\item Explicitly call \code{library(rJava)}
\item Load any package that imports \emph{rJava} (which auto-loads it as a dependency)
\item Even just use IDE autocomplete with \code{rJava::} (this triggers initialization!)
\item Call any \emph{rJava}-dependent function
}

Once any of these happen, the Java version used by \emph{rJava} for that session is locked in.
For command-line Java tools that don't use \emph{rJava}, this function can be called at any
time to switch Java versions for subsequent system calls.

# For end users: Ensure Java 21 is ready BEFORE loading rJava packages
library(rJavaEnv)
java_ensure(version = 21, type = "min")
# Now safe to load packages that depend on rJava

# For packages using command-line Java (not rJava):

  java_ensure(version = 17)
