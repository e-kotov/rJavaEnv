# rJavaEnv 0.2.2 (2024-09-13)

* Hot fix: improve robustness of setting Java environment in the current session with either `use_java()` or `java_quick_install()`. See bug fix below.

* Bug fix: Setting Java environment via `rJava::.jniInitialized()` rendered impossible changing Java version for `rJava`-dependent packages, because it somehow pre-initialised `rJava`

# rJavaEnv 0.2.1 (2024-09-03)

* Documentation and description clean-up

# rJavaEnv 0.2.0 (2024-08-28)

* Breaking change: `java_check_version_cmd()` and `java_check_version_rjava()` now return detected `Java` version instead of `TRUE`/`FALSE`

* New function `use_java()` to download, install and set `Java` from cache for the current sesssion, without touching the current project/working directory. This is intended for use with `targets` and `callr`.

* New vignette on using the package with `targets' and 'callr`

* Updated documentation with clearer instructions on cache folder cleanup before removing the package

* Depends on `R` > 4.0 to be able to write to the package cache directory without extra user warning. Cache cleanup and management functions are provided, as well as the documentation in both README and vignettes.
