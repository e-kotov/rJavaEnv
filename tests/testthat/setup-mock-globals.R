# This file is run automatically by testthat before tests are run.
# It's a good place for mocks that are used across multiple test files.

# NOTE: Mocks defined here with local_mocked_bindings() will NOT persist
# into the test files because the scope ends when this file finishes sourcing.
# Instead, we use helper-mocks.R which defines functions to apply mocks
# within the test scopes.
